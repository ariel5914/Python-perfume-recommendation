Hi everyone, I'm Ariel, a great perfume enthusiast and senior student at Sungshinn University in Seoul, South Korea, where I'm studying business and data-informatics.

Not too long ago, my interest with perfumery began with my first scent, Flower by Kenzo, a freebie my mom received during her shopping. Starting small my interest grew, leading to the creation of my perfume collection. With a keen sense of my preferred fragrances and favorite perfume house, I've curated a selection of top picks that often feature shared notes like sandalwood or woody essences.

This sparked an idea - what if I could use Python to compute similarity scores and develop an automated recommendation system for fellow enthusiasts like myself? Discovering 'new' and 'unknown' perfumes beyond one's usual choices, yet still resonating with the sought-after scents.

The world of perfumery is vast! In this notebook, I'll delve into the intricate details of how I crafted this program.


The dataset is enlisted with over 30,000 products.

The dataset is consisted with perfume brands, perfume names, and their notes (20 notes maximum), and gender column if that perfume is made for women or men, or unisex.
